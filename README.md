Description
-----------

A simple script inspired by [XKCD Comic #936](http://xkcd.com/936/) which 
generates a unique passphrase by taking several random words from the text of 
books, such as a book from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) 
to generate a single easy-to-remember passphrase. This is the official perl
script used to generate passphrases for new members who want to register.

At present this script also stores the passphrase in a database, you can simply
remove the database access lines to have it just print out the passphrase.
